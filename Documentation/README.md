# Documentation

This folder contains documentation for the SkyView firmware. Since this firmware is a fork based on the firmware for a similar board by LilyGo, the older release notes (Release_VBxxxx) are kept here for historic reasons and because they also describe some of the features that are still working on the Waveshare board as well.
